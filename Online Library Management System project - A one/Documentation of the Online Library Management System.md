###### **Design of the system:**

* The system is made up of 4 classes. They include:

1. user

2. book

3. BookCatalog

4. transactions



* Through these 4 classes, the system is able to allow the user to sign in, view the available books in the library through the catalog, and also be able to borrow from and return books to the library.
* Having few classes in the system makes it easy to understand and debug the program.



###### **Instructions on how to execute the program:**

1. First click, open, and run the C++ file called Library Management System using a C++ compiler after which you will be welcomed to the system.
2. You will then be required to input your name and the user identification number(User ID)
3. After successfully inputting your name and User ID, you will be directed to the main menu where you get to choose one option among three which include: 
   i)Search for a book 
   ii)Borrow/Return a book 
   iii)Exit. 
   If you choose the first option, you have the option of choosing a book either by title of the book as choice one or by the name of the author as choice two. There is also an option of viewing all the books that are available as choice three.
4. Choosing the second option will give you the privilege of borrowing or returning a book as long as it is available.
5. The third option exits the program.



###### **Instructions on how to run tests:**

* To carry out a given test, you just need to open the given test file that you want to carry out the test for, for example: if you want to carry out a test on the transaction class, you just need to open the test file called 'test_transaction' and run it using a C++ compiler. The tests give out both positive and negative scenarios that are based on the specific test that you have carried out.
